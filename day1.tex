	    \begin{itemize}
	    	\item Sheila is a student and she drives a typical student car: it is old, slow,
			rusty, and falling apart. Recently, the needle on the speedometer fell
			    off. She glued it back on, but she might have placed it at the wrong
			    angle. Thus, when the speedometer reads s, her true speed is s + c,
			    where c is an unknown constant (possibly negative).
			    Sheila made a careful record of a recent journey and wants to use
			    this to compute c. The journey consisted of n segments. In the i
			    th
			    segment she traveled a distance of di and the speedometer read si for
		  	    the entire segment. This whole journey took time t. Help Sheila by
		            computing c.
	                    Note that while Sheila's speedometer might have negative readings,her true speed was greater 			 than zero for each segment of the journey.

	    \begin{enumerate}
		\item input number of segments and total time
		\item taking the total time and distance of the journey calculate the actual speed and then compare it with the speed shown by the speedometer and compute the error c.
