Question analysis
▶ From the description of the project we could analyze that an
old car of a student has its speedometer needle
broken. However the student fixed it up again at the same
point but with a different angle. So now the speed shown in
the speedometer is less than the actual speed. We were
supposed to find the difference between the actual speed and
the speed that is being shown by the speedometer. This
difference is the error "c".

Input analysis:
▶ From the given input description we get to know that at first
we need to make the user input the number of segments ”n”
and the total time taken for the journey ”t”. Then based on
the number of segments there would be n other lines to take the
input from the user regarding the distance travelled and the
speed shown by the speedometer in that particular segment of
journey.

Sample input description:
▶ Lets say the user gave 3 segments as input. So we will have 3
other lines foe each segment of which each line has the
distance travelled in that particular segment and the speed
shown in the speedometer.
Sample Input analysis:
3 5
4 4
3 -1
5 2
So from the above we can observe that there were a total of 3
segments and the total time taken for the journey is 5
hours. In the next line of the input we have the distance
travelled(4miles) and speed of the speedometer(4miles per
hour) of the first segment followed by those of
second(3miles,-1miles per hour) and third(5miles and 2miles
per hour) segments. We could even notice that the speed in
second segment input is negative that is because the speed
shown on her speedometer is less than the actual
speed. Whereas the actual speed is greater than the speedometer speed.
